                        A filter is performed on the array.A condition is passed to the filter method.Returns a
                        completely new array by doing something with only those elements of the array for which the
                        condition is true.

                        method. But find() method return only an element which element is fill up this find() condition.

                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        <strong>local storage:</strong>
                        The data in localStorage remains even when the window, tab or
                        Computer is closed. That is the data remains until the user manually removes the data from their
                        Browser cache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>sessionStorage:</strong>
                        On the other hand, the data in the session storage is deleted when the window or tab is closed.
                        That is ,when the user closes the window, tab or the computer the data is lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Cookie:</strong>
                        are generally used to store small amounts of data and they have an expiration date.On the other
                        hand, localStorage and sessionStorage are used to store larger amounts of data and difference
                        data
                        stored duration.

                    <strong>Event loop</strong> and how does an event loop work
                </h4>
                <div class="">
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a single-threaded language.However,because of the event loop,JavaScript can still
                        run asynchronously work after it is single-threaded.<br>
                        Because the event loop has an event queue.That queue is briefly explained below with example
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h6><u>Here is an example:</u></h6>
                <div class="mx-auto w-50">
                    <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/event_loop.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <p> <strong>Call stack:</strong>
                        When the first function is called, the code within its scope is executed. The code on line two
                        is executed first, and then when the second function is called on line three, the execution of
                        the first function is paused, and the control is passed to the second function.
                        <br>
                        The second function then executes the code on line seven, and when the third function is called
                        on line eight, the execution of the second function is paused, and the control is passed to the
                        third function.
                        <br>
                        After executing the code on lines 12 and 13 of the third function, the control is passed back to
                        the second function where it left off, which is on line nine. Once the second function completes
                        its execution, the control is passed back to the first function where it left off, which is on
                        line four. The first function then completes its execution, and the call stack is empty.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <p> <strong>Event queue:</strong>
                        The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows
                        the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent
                        for execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API, which runs its own
                        single-threaded operation. An example of this is the setTimeout method, which is sent to the
                        corresponding API to wait for the specified time before sending the operation back to the event
                        queue.
                        <br>
                        The event queue is a data structure where events, such as user input or network responses, are
                        placed to be processed later. The event loop constantly checks whether the call stack is empty.
                        If it is, it checks the event queue for any pending tasks, such as callback functions, and
                        processes them. If the event queue is empty, the event loop waits for new tasks to be added to
                        the queue.
                        <br>
                        The browser APIs and event loop work together to create a non-blocking and asynchronous
                        environment in JavaScript, allowing multiple operations to be processed simultaneously without
                        blocking the main thread.
