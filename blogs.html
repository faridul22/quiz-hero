                        difference between them is:

                    <p>
                        <strong>local storage:</strong>
                        The data in localStorage remains even when the window, tab or
                        Computer is closed. That is the data remains until the user manually removes the data from their
                        Browser cache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>sessionStorage:</strong>
                        On the other hand, the data in the session storage is deleted when the window or tab is closed.
                        That is ,when the user closes the window, tab or the computer the data is lost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Cookie:</strong>
                        are generally used to store small amounts of data and they have an expiration date.On the other
                        hand, localStorage and sessionStorage are used to store larger amounts of data and difference
                        data
                        stored duration.
